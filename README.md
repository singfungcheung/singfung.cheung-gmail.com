# README

A program that uses <a href = "https://www.python.org/" target = "_blank">Python</a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping" target = "_blank">webscraping</a> for automating the task of saving photos.
Right-clicking and saving each individual images from a website can be very tedious and time consuming. 

Here is how it works:<br>
First, we have the program, which looks like this.

<p align = "center">
  <img src = "images/software.PNG" width = 500 height = 300>
</p>

To begin, we select where we want our images to be saved by clicking on the <strong>browse</strong> button, and the following window should pop up.
<p align = "center">
  <img src = "images/folder_path.PNG" width = 500 height = 300>
</p>

After selecting the destination, copy and paste a URL into the <strong>Enter Web URL</strong> box.
<p align = "center">
  <img src = "images/web_link.PNG" width = 500 height = 300>
</p>
<h2>Note</h2>
It should be noted that this program only works well with static websites (all the images already loaded). With sites that use <a href = "https://www.javascript.com/" target = "_blank">Javascript</a> and "<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_loading" target = "_blank">lazy loading<a>", this program will not work well.
Next, type in 
Happy webscraping!
